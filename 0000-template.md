## Summary

One paragraph explanation of the change.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

### Existing Projects

What projects are already working in this fashion?

### Working Group

Team that will be responsible for overseeing the experiment

### Proposal

Bulk of the RFC exists here.  Explain in enough detail for someone familiar with DevTools to understand and implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

### Alternative solutions

What other options are there?  What are the pros / cons of those options?

### Drawbacks

Why should we **not** we do this?

### Adoption

How will other DevTool tools adopt the feature?

### Metrics

What are the metrics we're looking at? How will we evaluate whether experiment was successful?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
